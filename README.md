# LIFT
Learning Fault Trees from Observational Data

Paper: https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-99154-2_19

Files generateFT.py and generateFTsofsize.py can generate all fault trees based on a fixed number of events. In our paper, this size is 8. File LIFT.py contains the code to learn a fault tree based on a statistical test (PAMH). File plotvariables.py tests LIFT with noisy data or superfluous variables, as described in the paper.
